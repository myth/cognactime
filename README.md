### Requirements

* NodeJS (CognacTime is developed using 0.12.x branch)

### Setup

If you can use `make` simply type:

```
make
```

Then you can start the development server by punching in:

```
npm run watch
```

To fire up the development server immediately, type the following command:

```
make dev
```

If you cannot use `make`, use the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run watch
```

#### For the really lazy

Just copy and paste into the terminal and start hacking away.

```
git clone git@github.com:myth/cognactime.git && cd cognactime && make dev
```

### Libraries used

See `package.json`.
